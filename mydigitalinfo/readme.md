Project Description: Due to COVID-19, It has become difficult for small business to verify the customer before letting them in to control the virus spread. Due to manual interaction involved, risk is bit high so I though to develop this app to generate the QR Code of my information which business can scan to retrieve the information.

Technology stack:
* Ionic 5
* Cordova
* Deployed Webservices on AWS using Dynamo DB to save the customer information
* angularx-qrcode for QR Code
